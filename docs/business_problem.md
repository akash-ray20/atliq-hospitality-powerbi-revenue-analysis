# Business Problem – AtliQ Grands Hospitality Revenue Analysis

## 🏨 Business Context
AtliQ Grands is a chain of luxury and business five-star hotels operating across multiple cities in India. The company has been in the hospitality industry for over 20 years and has built a strong presence in the premium hotel segment.

In recent years, however, AtliQ Grands has been facing a decline in **revenue and market share** within the luxury and business hotel categories. This decline is attributed to a combination of:
- Aggressive strategic moves by competitors
- Ineffective and delayed decision-making by management
- Limited visibility into key revenue and performance drivers

---

## 📉 Problem Statement
Despite having access to historical booking and operational data, AtliQ Grands lacks an **in-house data analytics capability** to convert this data into actionable insights. As a result, the revenue management team is unable to:
- Track performance consistently across properties and cities
- Identify demand and pricing inefficiencies
- Understand booking behavior across channels
- Monitor occupancy, capacity utilization, and realization effectively

This has limited the organization’s ability to respond proactively to changing market conditions.

## 🎯 Business Objective
To address this challenge, AtliQ Grands has decided to leverage **Business Intelligence and Data Analytics** as a strategic initiative. The revenue management team has engaged a third-party analytics provider to analyze historical data and deliver insights that can support data-driven decision-making.

The primary objective of this project is to build a **Level-1 Revenue Analytics Dashboard** that enables stakeholders to:
- Monitor key hospitality performance metrics
- Identify trends and patterns over time
- Compare performance across properties, room categories, and cities
- Evaluate booking channel effectiveness
- Support tactical and strategic revenue management decisions

---

## 📊 Scope of Analysis
The analysis focuses on historical data related to:
- Revenue performance
- Occupancy and capacity utilization
- Pricing efficiency (ADR and RevPAR)
- Booking realization and cancellations
- Weekday vs weekend demand behavior
- Channel-level booking patterns

The output is an interactive Power BI dashboard designed for **executive and revenue management users**, providing both high-level summaries and the ability to drill down into detailed views.

## ✅ Expected Outcome
The final dashboard is expected to:
- Improve visibility into key revenue drivers
- Enable faster and more informed decision-making
- Help identify underperforming properties and channels
- Serve as a foundation for more advanced analytics such as forecasting and optimization in future phases
